Spec-driven development keeps AI agents aligned with your architecture by providing specs alongside architecture diagrams for context-aware code generation.

---

## Extended Summary

AI coding assistants can write code fast, but they don't understand your system's design rules—so they create code that works, but breaks your architecture.

**The fix:** Give AI three things before it codes:
1. Architecture diagrams showing what exists
2. Specifications explaining business rules and design decisions  
3. Guidelines on how your team writes code

**The workflow:** Smart AI plans and creates specs → You review → Regular AI codes → Changes get documented

**Result:** AI that builds features the way your team would, respecting your architecture instead of accidentally breaking it.
